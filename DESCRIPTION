Description: Fit parametric models for time-to-event data that show an initial
    'incubation period', i.e., a variable phase where the hazard is zero. The
    delayed Weibull distribution serves as the foundational data model. The
    specific method of MSE (maximum spacing estimation) is used for parameter
    estimation. Bootstrap confidence intervals for parameters and significance
    tests in a two group setting are provided.
