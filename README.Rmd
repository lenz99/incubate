# incubate

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

Parametric time-to-event analysis where groups show an incubation period with different hazard.


## Example

With incubate, you can statistically compare the survival experience of two groups with respect to delay and other parameters.

```{r example}
library(incubate)

# simulate data from exponential distribution with delay
x <- rexp_delayed(n = 13, delay = 1.1)
y <- rexp_delayed(n = 11, delay = 1.6)

# fit delay model 
fm <- delay_model(x, y)

plot(fm)

delay_test <- test_delay_diff(x, y, R = 100)
plot(delay_test)
```

## Installation

The `incubate` package is hosted publicly at [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/imb-dev/incubate).
To install its latest version use from within an R-session:

``` r
remotes::install_gitlab("imb-dev/incubate")
```

To install a specific version, add the version tag after the name, separated by a `@`, e.g. to install `incubate` in version `v0.0.2` use

``` r
remotes::install_gitlab("imb-dev/incubate@v0.0.2")
```
