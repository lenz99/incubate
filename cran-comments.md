## Resubmission
This is a resubmission since a test failed on M1-Macs. In this version I have:

* make test data set more robust so that it passes on all platforms, in particular on M1-Macs.
* provide URL-field in DESCRIPTION for development-homepage
* Version bump for this resubmission to v1.1.7


## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.

There was 1 NOTE:

* checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... NOTE
  Maintainer: 'Matthias Kuhn <matthias.kuhn@tu-dresden.de>' Days since last update: 3

  This is my resubmission to fix test errors on M1-Macs.


## Downstream dependencies
There are currently no downstream dependencies for this package.
