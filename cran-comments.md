## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Provided a paragraph at the Description-field in DESCRIPTION
* Use LGPL licence (as this appears a better match, also after consulting colleagues). Dropped unnecessary separate licence file.
* No reference to vague statement 'incubate package authors'. I am the only author of this package.
* Documented all return values of exported functions
* Version bump for this resubmission to v1.1.6 (previous CRAN re-submission v1.1.5 got archived)


## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.

There was 1 NOTE:

* checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... NOTE
  Maintainer: 'Matthias Kuhn <matthias.kuhn@tu-dresden.de>' New submission

  This is indeed the first submission of this package to CRAN.


## Downstream dependencies
There are currently no downstream dependencies for this package.
