\title{Fit a delayed Exponential or Weibull model to one or two given sample(s).}
\usage{
delay_model(
  x = stop("Specify observations for at least one group x=!", call. = FALSE),
  y = NULL,
  distribution = c("exponential", "weibull"),
  twoPhase = FALSE,
  bind = NULL,
  ties = c("density", "equidist", "random", "error"),
  method = c("MPSE", "MLEn", "MLEw", "MLEc"),
  profile = FALSE,
  optim_args = NULL,
  verbose = 0
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{numeric. observations of 1st group. Can also be a list of data from two groups.}

\item{y}{numeric. observations from 2nd group}

\item{distribution}{character. Which delayed distribution is assumed? Exponential or Weibull.}

\item{twoPhase}{logical. Allow for two phases?}

\item{bind}{character. parameter names that are bind together in 2-group situation.}

\item{ties}{character. How to handle ties.}

\item{method}{character. Which method to fit the model? 'MPSE' = maximum product of spacings estimation \emph{or} 'MLEn' = naive maximum likelihood estimation \emph{or} 'MLEw' = weighted MLE' \emph{or} MLEc' = corrected MLE}

\item{profile}{logical. Profile out scale from log-likelihood if possibe.}

\item{optim_args}{list. optimization arguments to use. Use \code{NULL} to use the data-dependent default values.}

\item{verbose}{integer. level of verboseness. Default 0 is quiet.}
}
\value{
\code{incubate_fit} the delay-model fit object. Or \code{NULL} if optimization failed (e.g. too few observations).
}
\description{
Maximum product of spacings estimation is used by default to fit the parameters. Estimation via naive maximum likelihood (\verb{method = 'MLEn}) is available, too,
but MLEn yields biased estimates. MLEc is a corrected version of MLE due to Cheng.
}
\details{
Numerical optimization is done by \code{stats::optim}.
