\title{Fit a delayed Exponential or Weibull model to one or two given sample(s).}
\usage{
delay_model(
  x,
  y = NULL,
  distribution = c("exponential", "weibull"),
  bind = NULL,
  optim_args = NULL,
  verbose = 0
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{numeric. observations of 1st group. Can also be a list of data from two groups.}

\item{y}{numeric. observations from 2nd group}

\item{bind}{character. parameter names that are bind together in 2-group situation.}

\item{optim_args}{list. optimization arguments to use. Use \code{NULL} to use the data-dependent default values.}

\item{verbose}{integer. level of verboseness. Default 0 is quiet.}
}
\value{
\code{mps_fit} object that contains the information of the delayed model fit. Or \code{NULL} if optimization failed (e.g. too few observations).
}
\description{
Maximum product spacing is used to fit the parameters.
Numerical optimization is done by \code{stats::optim}.
}
