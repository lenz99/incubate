\title{Factory method for objective function, either according to maximum product of spacings estimation ('MPSE')
or according to naive maximum likelihood estimation ('MLEn').}
\usage{
objFunFactory(
  x,
  y = NULL,
  distribution = c("exponential", "weibull"),
  twoPhase = FALSE,
  bind = NULL,
  method = c("MPSE", "MLEn", "MLEc", "MLEw"),
  profile = FALSE,
  ties = c("density", "equidist", "random", "error"),
  verbose = 0L
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{numeric. observations}

\item{y}{numeric. observations in second group.}

\item{distribution}{character(1). delayed distribution family}

\item{twoPhase}{logical flag. Do we allow for two delay phases where event rate may change? Default is \code{FALSE}, i.e., a single delay phase.}

\item{bind}{character. parameter names that are bind together (i.e. equated) between both groups}

\item{method}{character(1). Specifies the method for which to build the objective function. Default value is \code{MPSE}. \code{MLEn} is the naive MLE-method, calculating the likelihood function as the product of density values. \code{MLEc} is the modified MLE.}

\item{profile}{logical. Should scale parameter be profiled out prior to optimization?}

\item{ties}{character. How to handle ties within data of a group.}

\item{verbose}{integer flag. How much verbosity in output? The higher the more output. Default value is 0 which is no output.}
}
\value{
the objective function (e.g., the negative MPSE criterion) for given choice of model parameters or \code{NULL} upon errors
}
\description{
Given the observed data this factory method produces an objective function
which is either the negative of the MPSE-criterion H or the negative log-likelihood for MLE.
}
\details{
The objective function takes a vector of model parameters as argument.

From the observations, negative or infinite values are discarded during pre-processing.
In any case, the objective function is to be minimized.
