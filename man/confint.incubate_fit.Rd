\usage{
\method{confint}{incubate_fit}(
  object,
  parm,
  level = 0.95,
  R = 199L,
  bs_data,
  bs_infer = c("normal", "normal0", "t", "quantile0", "quantile"),
  useBoot = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{R}{number of bootstrap replications}

\item{bs_data}{character or bootstrap data object. If character, it specifies which type of bootstrap is requested and the bootstrap data will be generated. Data can also be provided here directly. If missing it uses parametric bootstrap.}

\item{bs_infer}{character. Which type of bootstrap inference is requested to generate the confidence interval?}

\item{useBoot}{logical. Delegate bootstrap confint calculation to the \code{boot}-package?}
}
\value{
A matrix (or vector) with columns giving lower and upper confidence limits for each parameter.
}
\description{
Bias-corrected bootstrap confidence limits (either quantile-based or normal-approximation based) are generated.
At least R=1000 bootstrap replications are recommended. Default are normal-based confidence intervals.
