\usage{
\method{confint}{mps_fit}(
  object,
  parm,
  level = 0.95,
  R = 199L,
  bs_type = c("simple", "parametric"),
  type = c("normal", "quantile"),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{R}{number of bootstrap replications}

\item{bs_type}{character. Which type of bootstrap is requested?}

\item{type}{character. Which type of bootstrap inference is requested?}
}
\value{
A matrix (or vector) with columns giving lower and upper confidence limits for each parameter.
}
\description{
Bias-corrected bootstrap confidence limits (either quantile-based or normal-approximation based) are generated.
At least R=1000 bootstrap replications are recommended.
}
