\title{Test the difference for delay model parameter(s) between two uncorrelated groups.}
\usage{
test_delay_diff(
  x,
  y,
  distribution = c("exponential", "weibull"),
  param = "delay",
  R = 400
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{data from reference/control group.}

\item{y}{data from the treatment group.}

\item{distribution}{character\link{1}. Name of the parametric delay distribution to use.}

\item{param}{character\link{1}. Parameter to test difference for. Default value is \code{'delay'}.}

\item{R}{numeric\link{1}. Number of bootstrap samples to evaluate the distribution of the test statistic.}

\value{
test result: bootstrap P-value
}
\description{
It is in fact a model comparison between a null model where the parameters are enforced to be equal and an unconstrained full model.
As test statistic we use the difference in best (=lowest) objective function value (\code{val_0} - \code{val_1}).
This is reminiscent of a likelihood ratio test statistic albeit the objective function is not a negative log-likelihood
but the negative of the maximum product spacing metric.
}
\details{
High values of this difference speak against the null-model (i.e. high \code{val_0} indicates bad fit under 0-model and low values of \code{val_1} indicate a good fit under the more general model1.
The test is implemented as a parametric bootstrap test, i.e.
\enumerate{
\item we take given null-model fit as ground truth
\item we regenerate data according to this model.
\item we recalculate the test statistic
\item we appraise the observed test statistic in light of the generated distribution under H0
}
