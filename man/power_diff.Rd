\title{Power simulation function for a two-group comparison of the delay parameter.}
\usage{
power_diff(
  distribution = c("exponential", "weibull"),
  param = "delay",
  eff = stop("Provide parameters for both group that reflect the effect!"),
  n,
  sig.level = 0.05,
  nPowerSim = 1600,
  R = 201
)
}
\arguments{
\item{param}{character. Parameter name(s) for which to simulate the power.}

\item{eff}{list of length 2. Model parameters (as understood by the delay-distribution functions provided by this package) for two groups.}

\item{n}{integer. Number of observations per group for the power simulation. Can be two different numbers, control group and then treatment group.}

\item{nPowerSim}{integer. Number of simulation rounds. Default value 1600 yields a standard error of 0.01 for power if the true power is 80\%.}

\item{R}{integer. Number of bootstrap samples for test of difference in parameter within each power simulation. It affects the resolution of the P-value for each simulation round. A value of around \code{R=200} gives a resolution of 0.5\% which is enough for power analysis.}
}
\value{
List of results of power simulation. Or \code{NULL} in case of errors.
}
\description{
Given an effect size and a sample size \code{n} it simulates the power.
The more power simulation rounds (parameter \verb{nPowerSim=}) the more densely the space of data according to the specified model is sampled.
