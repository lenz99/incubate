\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector of values for which to get the density.}

\item{delay1}{numeric. The first delay, must be non-negative.}

\item{rate1}{numeric. The event rate, must be non-negative.}

\item{delay}{numeric. Alias for first delay.}

\item{rate}{numeric. Alias for first rate.}

\item{delay2}{numeric. The second delay, must be non-negative.}

\item{rate2}{numeric. The second event rate, must be non-negative.}

\item{q}{A numeric vector of quantile values.}

\item{...}{further arguments are passed on to the underlying non-delayed function, e.g., \verb{lower.tail=} to \code{\link[stats:Exponential]{stats::pexp()}}}

\item{p}{A numeric vector of probabilities.}

\item{n}{integer. Number of random observations requested.}

\item{t}{A numeric vector of times that restrict the mean survival. Default is \code{+Inf}, i.e., the unrestricted mean survival time.}
}
\value{
Functions pertaining to the delayed exponential distribution:
\itemize{
\item \code{dexp_delayed} gives the density
\item \code{pexp_delayed} gives the distribution function
\item \code{qexp_delayed} gives the quantile function
\item \code{rexp_delayed} generates a pseudo-random sample
\item \code{mexp_delayed} gives the restricted mean survival time
}

The length of the result is determined by \code{n} for \code{rexp_delayed}, and is the maximum of the lengths of the numerical arguments for the other functions, R's recycling rules apply.
}
\description{
Density, distribution function, quantile function, random generation and restricted mean survival time function for the delayed exponential distribution with \code{rate}-parameter.
}
\details{
Additional arguments are forwarded via \code{...} to the underlying functions of the exponential distribution in the \code{stats}-package.
The numerical arguments other than \code{n} are recycled to the length of the result. delay1/2 and rate1/2 are recycled together.
Only the first elements of the logical arguments are used.
